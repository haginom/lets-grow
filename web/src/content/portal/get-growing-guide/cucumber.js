  "Place the seed on its side in the hole.",
  "Cover over the seed with a little compost then water very gently.",
  "Place on a windowsill indoors, or in another warm light place.",
  "Within a week or so you will start to see some green leaves.",
  "The plant will grow two leaves at first. Then it will grow a third leaf that will look different to the first two. These new leaves are called the 'true leaves' and all of the plant's new leaves will look like this.",
  "When the plant has three leaves it will probably look a bit too big for its pot. You should now 'pot on'. 'Potting on' just means that you are moving your plant into a bigger pot, to give it more room to grow.",

  "Fill the container to around 5cm from the top.",
  "Gently hold your hand around the seedling to stop it from falling to the floor and turn its pot upside down, giving the pot a little squeeze if the plant needs a little encouragement to come out of the pot.",
  "You should be able to see the roots of your plant.",
  "Now make a hole in the compost in the centre of your large container. The hole should be just big enough to pop your seedling into.",
  "Put your seedling into the hole and push the compost around its base a little to make sure that there are no big air pockets around the plant.",
  "Now give the plant a gentle but generous watering.",
  "Continue to water your cucumber plants regularly, if possible using a tomato feed weekly. (Follow the directions on the bottle of the particular feed that you buy).",
  "Some varieties of cucumber will be 'bush' varieties, these will not need any support.",
  "Others will be 'vine' varieties and will need a little support if they are not going to sprawl across your greenhouse.",
  "You can put three bamboo canes into your pot to make a tripod and tie it at the top with string to secure.",
  "As the cucumber grows, gently wrap the vines up the canes to encourage them to grow up rather than out, tying very gently with garden string if need be.",
  "Expect to harvest 6 to 10 weeks after planting.",
  "You should harvest the cucumbers by cutting them off with a sharp knife when they are still small. (You can involve children by getting them to point out the ones that are ready for picking and then you use the knife to safely remove the fruit).",
  "You should enjoy plenty of mini cucumbers from just one plant. Children will enjoy watching the fruits growing day by day and deciding when they are big enough to be eaten.",
